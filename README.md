# Install
install by running `pip install --user git+https://github.com/mjtadema/pytris.git`

# Features
Moving of blocks, removing of full rows, dying when reaching the top
Now it also has scoring, colors and music! :D

# Issues
No multiplayer?
Also some of the code needs some refactoring
Should be aware of terminal size and resize the game accordingly
