# PyTris
Proof of concept tetris game in python using curses!

# Features
Moving of blocks, removing of full rows, dying when reaching the top

# Issues
Rotating blocks seems kinda iffy
Also some block definitions are a bit off
No scoring implemented yet
Graphics should be a bit nicer
Could use a sweet soundtrack
No multiplayer?
Also some of the code needs some refactoring
