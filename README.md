# PyTris
Proof of concept tetris game in python using curses!
Tip: Install "simpleaudio" using pip to get sound! :D

# Features
Moving of blocks, removing of full rows, dying when reaching the top
Now it also has scoring, colors and music! :D

# Issues
No multiplayer?
Also some of the code needs some refactoring
Should be aware of terminal size and resize the game accordingly
